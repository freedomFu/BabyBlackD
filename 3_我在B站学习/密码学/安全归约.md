# 安全归约

## 一、定义（算法和安全模型）

### 经典密码学和现代密码学的区别

- 经典密码 classical cryptography was referred to as art.
- 20世纪末期之后，密码学称为科学science，也即Modern Cryptography
- 现代密码学与经典密码不同，主要体现在定义definition、模型model和证明proof
	- 算法的定义、困难猜想、优势…
	- 计算模型、安全模型…
	- Security reduction安全归约, game-hopping proof…
		- 都不是适用于所有的证明

#### Cryptology = Cryptography + Cryptanalysis

- *Cryptography*, such as public-key cryptography, group-based cryptography, and elliptic-curve cryptography, is a security mechanism to provide security services for authentication, confidentiality, integrity, etc.
- *Cryptoanalysis* is to analyze existing crytpography. 分析attack、relationship…
- *Cryptosystem*, such as digital signatures, public-key encryption, and identity-based encryption, is a suite of algorithms that provides ONE security service or more.
- *Scheme*, such as the BLS scheme, is a specific construction of the corresponding algorithms for ONE cryptosystem. 对Cryptosystem的具体构造和实现方法，scheme每一个算法都可以独立运行的，但是protocol是多个实体的交互。

Tradeoff：每一个算法都有自己的优势和劣势。

### 如何定义算法？

#### How to define algorithms for a Cryptosystem?

可以通过讲故事的方式来介绍协议或算法

- Fully understand the security services(s) (motivation).
- Which entities (e.g., signer) are involved.
- How many algorithms are involved. 越少越好✨
- What is the name of each algorithm.
- Who will runs each algorithm.
- What are inputs and outputs of each algorithm (objects). ✨
- What correctness must the algorithm satisfy?

#### 如何为数字签名定义算法？

##### **Motivation**

- A party, say Alice, wants to convince all other parties that a message $m$ is published by her.
- To do so, Alice generates a public/secret key pair (pk, sk) and publishes the public key $pk$ to all verifiers.
- To generate a signature $δ_m$ on $m$, she digitally signs $m$ With her secret key sk.
- Upon receiving $(m,δ_m)$, any receiver who already knows $pk$ can verify the signature $δ_m$ and confirm the origin of the message $m$

Which entities (not names) are involved. **Signer, Verifier**，而不用Alice这些，这些name只用于讲故事的时候用到

How algorithms are involved. 1(system parameter generation, called SysGen) + 3（产生公私钥对KeyGen、签名Sign、验证签名Verify）.取名字一定要很美观大气，尽量和算法有关。

Who runs each algorithm. **SysGen(Authority), KeyGen(Signer), Sign(Signer), Verify(Verifier)**

> A signer can generate a system parameter for him/her to use alone so that SysGen is run by Signer.

##### 算法

> - 箭号，而不是等号，不要随便使用等号
> - 签发输入是否需要公钥，其实都可以
>
> $SysGen(λ)→SP$
>
> $KeyGen(SP)→(pk,sk)$
>
> $Sign(SP,sk,m)→δ_m$
>
> $Verify(m,δ_m,SP,pk)→{0,1}$
>
> - input and output OBJECTS only for algorithm defintion
> - **Note** Which objects must be defined in each algorithm should be well considered. For example, can the verification algorithm include $sk$ as the input?

##### 形式化定义(定义可以抄袭别人，但是需要修修改改)

- $SysGen$:The system parameter generation algorithm takes as input a security parameter λ. It returns the system parameters SP.
- $KeyGen$:The key generation algorithm takes as input the system parameters SP. It returns a public/secret key pair(pk, sk).
- $Sign$: The signing algorithm taks as input a message m from its message space, the secret key sk, and the system parameters SP. It returns a signature of m denoted by $δ_m$
- $Verify$:The verification algorithm takes as input a pair $(m,δ_m)$, the public key pk, and the system parameters SP. It returns “accept” if  $δ_m$ is a valid signature of m signed with sk; otherwise, “reject”.

**Note** All algorithm are probabilistic polynomial time algorithms.

##### 正确性

任何内容，产生一次就一定是可以用的！

The algorithm defition must satisfy some Correctness.

- In digital signatures, all generated signatures can be verified.
- In encryption, all generated ciphertexts can be decrypted.

The correctness should hold for all outputs such as all key pairs.

**Note:** The correctness is related to services of cryptosystems.

### 如何定义安全模型？

#### 三个问题

- How to analyze the security of a scheme?
- Can a scheme (secure in a security model) resist any attack?
- Is a security model defined for a scheme?

#### 什么是Security Model?

- When we propose a scheme for a cryptosystem, we do not analyze its security against a list of attacks, such as replay attack and collusion attack. Instead, we analyze that the proposed scheme is secure in a security model.
