# 安全归约

## 一、定义（算法和安全模型）

### 经典密码学和现代密码学的区别

- 经典密码 classical cryptography was referred to as art.
- 20世纪末期之后，密码学称为科学science，也即Modern Cryptography
- 现代密码学与经典密码不同，主要体现在定义definition、模型model和证明proof
	- 算法的定义、困难猜想、优势…
	- 计算模型、安全模型…
	- Security reduction安全归约, game-hopping proof…
		- 都不是适用于所有的证明

#### Cryptology = Cryptography + Cryptanalysis

- *Cryptography*, such as public-key cryptography, group-based cryptography, and elliptic-curve cryptography, is a security mechanism to provide security services for authentication, confidentiality, integrity, etc.
- *Cryptoanalysis* is to analyze existing crytpography. 分析attack、relationship…
- *Cryptosystem*, such as digital signatures, public-key encryption, and identity-based encryption, is a suite of algorithms that provides ONE security service or more.
- *Scheme*, such as the BLS scheme, is a specific construction of the corresponding algorithms for ONE cryptosystem. 对Cryptosystem的具体构造和实现方法，scheme每一个算法都可以独立运行的，但是protocol是多个实体的交互。

Tradeoff：每一个算法都有自己的优势和劣势。

### 如何定义算法？

#### How to define algorithms for a Cryptosystem?

可以通过讲故事的方式来介绍协议或算法

- Fully understand the security services(s) (motivation).
- Which entities (e.g., signer) are involved.
- How many algorithms are involved. 越少越好✨
- What is the name of each algorithm.
- Who will runs each algorithm.
- What are inputs and outputs of each algorithm (objects). ✨
- What correctness must the algorithm satisfy?

#### 如何为数字签名定义算法？

##### **Motivation**

- A party, say Alice, wants to convince all other parties that a message $m$ is published by her.
- To do so, Alice generates a public/secret key pair (pk, sk) and publishes the public key $pk$ to all verifiers.
- To generate a signature $δ_m$ on $m$, she digitally signs $m$ With her secret key sk.
- Upon receiving $(m,δ_m)$, any receiver who already knows $pk$ can verify the signature $δ_m$ and confirm the origin of the message $m$

Which entities (not names) are involved. **Signer, Verifier**，而不用Alice这些，这些name只用于讲故事的时候用到

How algorithms are involved. 1(system parameter generation, called SysGen) + 3（产生公私钥对KeyGen、签名Sign、验证签名Verify）.取名字一定要很美观大气，尽量和算法有关。

Who runs each algorithm. **SysGen(Authority), KeyGen(Signer), Sign(Signer), Verify(Verifier)**

> A signer can generate a system parameter for him/her to use alone so that SysGen is run by Signer.

##### 算法

> - 箭号，而不是等号，不要随便使用等号
> - 签发输入是否需要公钥，其实都可以
>
> $SysGen(λ)→SP$
>
> $KeyGen(SP)→(pk,sk)$
>
> $Sign(SP,sk,m)→δ_m$
>
> $Verify(m,δ_m,SP,pk)→{0,1}$
>
> - input and output OBJECTS only for algorithm defintion
> - **Note** Which objects must be defined in each algorithm should be well considered. For example, can the verification algorithm include $sk$ as the input?

##### 形式化定义(定义可以抄袭别人，但是需要修修改改)

- $SysGen$:The system parameter generation algorithm takes as input a security parameter λ. It returns the system parameters SP.
- $KeyGen$:The key generation algorithm takes as input the system parameters SP. It returns a public/secret key pair(pk, sk).
- $Sign$: The signing algorithm taks as input a message m from its message space, the secret key sk, and the system parameters SP. It returns a signature of m denoted by $δ_m$
- $Verify$:The verification algorithm takes as input a pair $(m,δ_m)$, the public key pk, and the system parameters SP. It returns “accept” if  $δ_m$ is a valid signature of m signed with sk; otherwise, “reject”.

**Note** All algorithm are probabilistic polynomial time algorithms.

##### 正确性

任何内容，产生一次就一定是可以用的！

The algorithm defition must satisfy some Correctness.

- In digital signatures, all generated signatures can be verified.
- In encryption, all generated ciphertexts can be decrypted.

The correctness should hold for all outputs such as all key pairs.

**Note:** The correctness is related to services of cryptosystems.

### 如何定义安全模型？

#### 三个问题

- How to analyze the security of a scheme?
- Can a scheme (secure in a security model) resist any attack?
- Is a security model defined for a scheme?

#### 什么是Security Model?

- When we propose a scheme for a cryptosystem, we do not analyze its security against a list of attacks, such as replay attack and collusion attack. Instead, we analyze that the proposed scheme is secure in a security model.
- A security model can be seen as an *abstract of multiple attacks for a cryptosystem*. If a proposed scheme is secure in a security model, it is secure against any attack that can be described and captured in this security model.
- *Abstracted attacks* focus on what information the adversary learns instead of how the adversary learns these information.
- A security model is defined for a cryptosystem not for a scheme.

#### 如何定义Security Model?

We can use a game played between *adversary* and *challenger* to describe a security model. (一定是只有两方，没有第三方)

-   The challenger is the secret key owner of a cryptosystem.
-   The adversary is trying to break the cryptosystem.

##### A security model defines:

-   The adversary’s **capabilities**:
    -   *What* information the adversary can query
    -   *When* the adversary can query information
-   The adversary’s **security goal**
    -   *How* the adversary wins the game (breaks the cryptosystem)

##### How to Define a Security Model?

Be composed of four parts:

-   **Setup:** The initialization between the adversary and the challenger.
-   **Capabilities:** Describe what and when the adversary queries.
-   **Security Goal:** The condition of wining the game for the adversary.
-   **Advantage:** Define a parameter satisfying. (后续讲到)
    -   If the parameter is negligible, the cryptosystem is secure.
    -   Otherwise, the parameter is non-negligible and it is insecure.

##### When Defining a Security Model?

We consider *input and output* only the same as algorithm definition. The definition must be applicable to all potential schemes (proposed for a cryptosystem).

For example, when the adversary queries a signature on a message m, the challenger must respond to this query by running the signing algorithm with $(pk,sk,m)$ as input to output signature $δ_m$

-   We don’t care how to generate the signature $δ_m$.
-   We don’t care what the signature looks like (is just of symbol denoted by $δ_m$)
-   We **only** care what the adversary queried (i.e., the message m)

**We defining a security model, we <u>don’t</u> consider**

-   The adversary’s *trivial attack* that can help the adversary break the cryptosystem easily. For example, the adversary asks the challenger to share all secrets (e.g. all secret keys) with it.
-   The adversary’s *strategy* about how it obtains a piece of information. Therefore, when the adversary makes a query, the challenger must respond to this query *correctly and honestly.*

When defining a security model, make sure that *the advantage is <u>negligible</u>.*

(Therefore, the adversary is restricted in some queries.)否则，说明安全模型的定义是有问题的。

#### Security Model for Digital Signatures

-   **Setup:** A key pair is generated and the adversary knows pk.
-   **Capabilities:** The adversary obtains signatures of some messages.
-   **Goal:**The adversary cannot forge signature of a new message.
-   **Advantage:** The probability of successful forgery.

**Trivial Attack:** The adversary queries the signing/secret key. It can easily win the game. Any attack that will make advantage=1 must be forbidden.

#### Security Model的注解

-   A cryptosystem might have more than one security service.
-   Each security service could need one security model. For example: signcryption = signature + encryption. 
    -   Two security models: cannot break signature, cannot break encryption
-   A security model could capture multiple security definitions(services). An example is anonymous receiver with message indistinguishability in IBE. (基于身份的加密)

Standard Model是一种计算模型，而不是安全模型

标准的安全模型不一定是最强的安全模型

-   安全模型的使用，是与应用相关的
-   抽象成一些计算问题

### 实例

在密码学走得远，一定要自己去动手做才可以

-   通过自己的练习提高自己的能力
